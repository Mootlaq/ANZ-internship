# ANZ-internship
This project is part of an internship I did with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.

The repo consists of the jupyter notebook where all my work is and the two powerpoint files (in PDF form) I sent to ANZ.

### The Tasks
The first task was an exploratory analysis. I was tasked to report the findings like the average amount of transaction and customers' volume of transactions over a period of time. 

In the second one I was tasked to find any correlation between attributes and if there's one apply a logistic regression model or a decision tree model so that the company can use it to segment customers into income brackets.
